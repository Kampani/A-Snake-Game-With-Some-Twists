# A-Snake-Game-With-Some-Twists
Here I have created my very own version of the classic snake game which first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110.
It was programmed by Taneli Armanto, a design engineer in Nokia.
The concept originated from the 1976 arcade game 'Blockade', developed and published by Gremlin.

This version of mine includes some interesting new features developed and programmed by me. Some new ones are still under progress ( will be deployed soon when I find the correct working logic for them :P )

The code should run fine in most of the c/c++ compilers.
