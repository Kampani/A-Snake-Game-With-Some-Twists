# A-Snake-Game-With-Some-Twists
Here I have created my very own version of the classic snake game which first appeared in 1997 on the Nokia 6110.
It was programmed by Taneli Armanto, a design engineer in Nokia.
The concept originated from the 1976 arcade game 'Blockade', developed and published by Gremlin.

This version of mine includes some interesting new features developed and programmed by me. Some new ones are still under progress ( will be deployed soon when I find the correct working logic for them :P )
The code should should run fine in the gcc/g++ group of compilers.

Feel free to fork the code in your own system and play the game. Also if you beat the highscore you can display it up in the code's draw() function and create a pull request with the screenshot so that I can allow the changes.
Also feel free to raise an issue if you spot a bug. Create a pull request if you're able to solve it.
Suggestions are welcome.

Thankyou
